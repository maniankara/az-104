        - Account           - ID (user/app)
        - Tenant            - Organisation (+ instance of AD)
        - Subscription      - Billing (Tenants can have 0 or multiple subscriptions)
        - Resource          - Object/Sub-resource (VM, publicIP etc.), is attached to only 1 Resource group
        - Resource group    - Resource folder (bulk deletion/granual control etc.)
    - Azure policy:
        - Enforce standards+SLAs
        - Built-in: Allowed VMs, Allowed locations, Allowed Resource type etc.
        - Can go granual until Resource
        - Can Audit (log/compliance report), Enforce (prevent), Deploy (threat detection enabled), Require (SQL version X)
        - Custom policy
    - Subscriptions and Management groups:
        - An account can have multiple subscriptions, add multiple users and azure policies: gets messy -> Management group
        - Management group:
            - can manage subscriptions
            - Hold multiple subscriptions and assign granular permissions
            - Hold heirarchical Management groups (departments in a company/cost center)
            - Similar to resource group but for subscriptions
            - Do not have to fiddle with the permissions of Subscriptions

Section 5: Monitor resources using Azure Monitor (* 2 ways of creating alerts)
    - Diagnostics:
        - Virtual machines -> Vm -> Diagnostics setting -> Overview, metrics, syslog, Agent
        - Monitoring -> Virtual machines -> Performance (all vms?)
    - Baseline environment:
        - Resource Groups -> az-104 -> Export Templates -> template, parameters
        - Templates -> az-104-rp-template -> JSON
    *- Create alerts:
        - Resource -> Alerts -> new alert -> scope, condition, action group
        - Alerts -> list, manage rules
    - Create metrics:
        - Monitor -> metrics -> Select resource -> graph
        - Not persistent as default
    - Action group:
        - can define multiple actions in action group (email, call function etc.)
        - any condition can trigger any action group (re-usable)
    - Manage costs:
        - Subscriptions -> Free-Trial -> Cost management (create a budget etc.) => per subscription
        - Cost management+Billing -> Cost management                            => Over all
    *- Log analytics:
        - Log analytics workspaces -> VM (attach) 
                                    -> Logs -> new query -> Alerts

        - Shared access Signature is a token which can contain time-duration+limit access (R/W) etc.
    - Storage:
        - Containers -> file: 
            - Containers can define access scope too (public/private etc.)
            - If the storage account is in a different network, then we get error for white-listing
            - Storage explorer: built-in and clients for windows, mac and linux
    - Log analytics:
        - Storage account   -> Diagnostics - more of settings
                            -> Metrics - graphs
                            -> Alerts -

        - Backup:
            - associate storage account -> Choose what to backup (file share) -> back up policy
    - OnPrem Backups:
        - files/folders: Agent installation
        - Hyper-V, SQL Server: Dedicated server software
    - Backups reports:
        - Can be streamed, copied to storage account or analytics (power BI)
        - One needs to select what type of log/category that needs to be reported.
    - Soft delete:
        - Data stored for 14 days by default after deletion, can be restored by undelete()
        - Auto deleted 15th day
    - (*)Azure site recovery:
        - Creates a stand-by setup for a given recovery
        - Set up recovery: E.g. VM -> disaster recovery (Operations) -> start replication
        - Disks (costs) and network interface are created ahead
    - (*) Azure site recovery test:
        - disaster recovery (Operations)    -> Failover (breaks replication and origin)
                                            -> Test Failover (Just creates the necessary resources)
                                            -> Clean up test Failover (Cleans up the resources from Test failover)

            - Outbound VM communication - Connection Troubleshoot
            - VPN Troubleshoot - VPN Diagnostics
            - All network traffic to/from VM - variable packet capture
        - VPN:
            - Site2Site: Azure (virtual gateway (vnet), local network gateway (onPrem vnet details)) <-> OnPrem
                - Local network gateway: IP address -> VPN gateway address, IP address range -> CIDR block of onPrem address range
            - Point/Site to Site VPN: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/point-to-site-about
                - Check for space for gateway subnet in site2site VPN

            Hybrid identity:
                - AD seamless SSO: signs users in when they are on their corporate devices connected to your corporate network.
                - AD connect:
                    - password hash sync: onPrem-AD -> Azure AD (AD password sync)
                    - Pass through: \o/ -> (OnPrem cred.) Azure AD -> OnPrem AD
                    - Federated AD: OnPrem AD+ Azure AD
                - AD connect more:
                    - user roles: Azure AD (Azure AD Global Administrator) <-> Enterprise Administrator
