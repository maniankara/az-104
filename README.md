My personal notes of preparation of Microsoft Azure Associate certification - [AZ-104](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-104)

## Introduction
In my case the study path was very simple:
    - Udemy Scott Duffy - AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator Exam certification 2020
    - Some sample tests here and there

## Tips
1. Try to use portal, Azure CLI and Azure powerShell/bash as much as possible
2. Learn and solve applied and real world usecases
